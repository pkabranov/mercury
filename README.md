In dense urban areas, people lose items every day. One way to leverage this environment to solve our problem is to create a crowdsourcing platform that connects people who find misplaced belongings to those that are seeking them out.

## Feature Breakdown 
- **Finders report found items:** If a user spots an unattended item in a public place, they can report the location and description of the item. Finders will be directed to the nearest lost-and-found as an option to drop off the item.
- **Seekers report lost items:** If a user has lost an item in a public place, they can create a post about the item with its last known location and description
- **Searchable item database for seekers:** Seekers can view item database to determine if their item has already been collected by a Finder
- **Searchable item database for finders:** Finders can go through items in the database to see what has been lost and attempt to find that lost item. 
- **Reward System:** Seekers can post rewards for finding their items, finders can earn those rewards
- **In-app chat:** Finders and seekers can talk to each other to exchange the item (with a possible reward).
- **ID Verification:** Users need to have their Cal Student ID to create an account.
